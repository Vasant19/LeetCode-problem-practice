# LeetCode Problem Practice Repository

Welcome to my LeetCode problem practice repository! This repository serves as documentation of my journey in solving various algorithmic problems, optimizing solutions, and reducing complexity.

## Contents

- **Documented Solutions**: Each solution includes clear explanations of the approach, implementation details, and how constraints are met.
- **Algorithmic Optimizations**: I focus on optimizing algorithms and ensuring efficient solutions.
- **Complexity Reduction**: Strategies for reducing time and space complexity will be highlighted.
- **Programming Language**: All implementations will be done in **C++** & **Python**.

## Objectives

- **Practice and Master Algorithms**: Regularly solving problems to enhance my data structure and algorithm knowledge base.
- **Document Learning**: Keep track of my learning process and solutions to refer back to.
- **Help Others**: Provide clear explanations and insights to assist others in their problem-solving journey.

## Problem Sets

I will be practicing problems from:

- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problemset/)
- [Deep-ML](https://www.deep-ml.com/)

Each problem solution will include:

1. **Problem Description**: A brief overview of the problem (linked).
2. **Constraints**: Details on constraints and how they are addressed in the solution (linked).
3. **Solution Code**: The implemented code with comments explaining each step (included as comments in the code files).
4. **Optimization Techniques**: Any techniques or strategies used to optimize the solution (included as comments in the code files).
